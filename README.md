# Challenge-2-Repo
Portfolio page for the second weekly assignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
This assignment's purpose was utilizing the html and css I've developed over my time in bootcamp in order to launch a portfolio page.
While there are currently placeholder elements on the page, my portfolio will be updated overtime as I complete new projects and develop new skills. 
It is important to know, in my assets folder, I have various images, but I did chose not to reference these local files in my html or css files. 
Instead, I chose to host these images on Google Photos, and url link to them. This was done to resolve a directory naming issue I had.
